Designing an intelligent agent
This lab creates a simple intelligent agent that can navigate a 2D grid world, detects obstacles and find a target using decision-making techniques.
1 Environment setup: create a 5Ã—5 gtid with obstacles and targets
2 step 2: Agent design
3 step 3: agent simulation loop
4 step 4: pathfinding enhancement

Requirements 
1. python programming language
2. import necessary libraries like numpy, queue
